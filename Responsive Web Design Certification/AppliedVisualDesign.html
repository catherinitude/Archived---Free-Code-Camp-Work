    <h1> Applied Visual Design</h1>
    <p>HTML has some styling elements like strong, em, and u. While these do style font to look a set way, they should not be used just for styling. Each of these types of elements has a meaning and should only be used when conveying that meaning. Use CSS if your just trying to style something!</p>
    <hr>
    <p>That line is a horizontal line placed with hr. This element tag is self closing. </p>
    <h2>Positioning Elements</h2>
    <p>You can move elements around the page using the position property a few ways. these include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Relative  -  moves the element relative to its current position in the normal flow of the page with a offset properties pairing  of left or right, and top or bottom</li>
        <li>Absolute  -  this removes the element from the normal flow of the document, so surrounding items ignore it.  Locked relative to its closest positioned ancestor.</li>
        <li>Fixed  -   type of absolute positioning that locks an element relative to the browser window.</li>
        <li>Sticky -  Sticky positioning is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. The element is treated as relative positioned until it crosses a specified threshold, at which point it is treated as fixed positioned.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Floats  -  Floating elements are removed from the normal flow of a document and pushed to either the left or right of their containing parent element. Float:left; or Float:right;</p>
    <p>If elements overlap by default the element that comes first will be on "top" of the other element. You can take control of this with the z-index property. z-index: #; number = integer, higher value = more near the top.</p>
    <p>the style of margin: auto; will center a block element horizontally.</p>
    <h2>Color Theory</h2>
    <p>When two colors are opposite each other on the wheel, they are called complementary colors. When placed side-by-side, these colors appear more vibrant and produce a strong visual contrast. Check out the info on <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_colors">Wikipedia!</a></p>
    <p>Tertiary colors are the result of combining a primary color with one of its secondary color neighbors.</p>
    <p>Split-complementary color scheme. This scheme starts with a base color, then pairs it with the two colors that are adjacent to its complement. The three colors provide strong visual contrast in a design, but are more subtle than using two complementary colors.</p>
    <p>Strong visual contrast can be jarring if it's overused.</p>
    <p>The hsl() color value, uses a color wheel concept instead of the spectrum, where the angle of the color on the circle is given as a value between 0 and 360, a saturation value and a lightness value.Example: Red = hsl(0, 100%, 50%)</p>
    <p>You can create gradients with the linear-gradient property like so: background: linear-gradient(90deg, red, yellow, rgb(204, 204, 255));</p>
    <h2>Transform Property</h2>
    <p>The transform property allows you to change the rendering of elements such as: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Scale  -  changes the size.  Example: transform: scale(2.7)</li>
        <li>Skew  -  skews the selected element along the provided axis. Example:  transform: skewX(-32deg);  transform: skewY(-32deg);</li>
