    <h1> Applied Visual Design</h1>
    <p>HTML has some styling elements like strong, em, and u. While these do style font to look a set way, they should not be used just for styling. Each of these types of elements has a meaning and should only be used when conveying that meaning. Use CSS if your just trying to style something!</p>
    <hr>
    <p>That line is a horizontal line placed with hr. This element tag is self closing. </p>
