    <h1>Applied Accessibility Notes</h1>
    <p>Websites should be open and accessible to everyone. CAre should be taken to keep the needs of all needs while
        developing. This area of web development is very important and some people devote their whole careers to
        insuring site meet the current standards. These standards are set by <a
            href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/">W3C</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Some Guidelines</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>img tags must include an alt attribute with a brief description of the image.</li>
        <li>If the image is purely decorative the alt attribute should be an empty string.</li>
        <li>Headings (1-6) help structure content. Some screen readers can be set to only read headings.</li>
        <li>Headings (1-6) should be placed in logical order, uss css of you want a different look!</li>
        <li>Use semantic elements were appropriate.
            <ul>
                <li>main - goes around the main content, normally the stuff between the header and footer elements.
                </li>
                <li>article - a sectioning element, and is used to wrap independent, self-contained content. </li>
                <li>section - for grouping thematically related content. (When there's no relationship between groups of
                    content, then use a div)</li>
                <li>header - wrap introductory information or navigation links for its parent tag and works well around
                    content that's repeated at the top on multiple pages.</li>
                <li>nav - wraps main navigation links</li>
                <li>footer - primarily used to contain copyright information or links to related documents that usually
                    sit at the bottom of a page</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Audio should have the controls attribute and some text for people unable to hear the sound. </li>
        <li>Videos should have transcripts or captions added.</li>
        <li>Use figure and figcaption to give a text alternative. For data visualizations the caption should briefly
            summarize the trends or conclusions. </li>
        <li>For forms...</li>
        <ul>
            <li>label tag wraps the text for a specific form control item, usually the name or label for a choice</li>
            <li>for attribute on a label tag explicitly associates that label with the form control and is used by
                screen readers.</li>
            <li>The value of the for attribute must be the same as the value of the id attribute of the form control
            </li>
            <li>fieldset tag surrounds the entire grouping of radio buttons to achieve this.</li>
            <li>Use a legend tag to provide a description for the grouping</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Use the time element along with a datetime attribute to standardize times.</li>
        <li>CSS's can be used to hide content meant only for screen readers. (display: none or visibility: hidden, and
            0px sizing remove the element and screen readers can't see them. Use some thing like: <BR>.sr-only {
            <BR>position: absolute;
            <BR>left: -10000px;
            <BR>width: 1px;
            <BR>height: 1px;
            <BR>top: auto;
            <BR>overflow: hidden; }
        </li>
    </ul>
        <li>Colors should have at least a 4.5 to 1 contrast ratio for normal text. (<a href ="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">test here</a>)</li>
        <li>Having a list of "click here" or "read more" links is not helpful, try to make link text descriptive.</li>
        <li>Use the accesskey attribute to specify a shortcut key to activate or bring focus to an element</li>
        <li>The tabindex attribute effects keyboard focus so that you can tab from element to element. In most cases top down focus is what should be used.</li>
    </ul>
