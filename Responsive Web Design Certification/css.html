        <h1 style="color:orangered;">CSS!</h1>
        <p>You can add styles with CSS in HTML tags with the style attribute. This is called inline CSS.</p>
        <p class="green-text">You can also add styles with a style block.</p>
        <p class="indigo-text">The most popular way to style is with external files. You have to link the external page
            for this to work.</p>
        <p>I have added code between [ ] on this page, when using the code omit the brackets.  I have also not included all the ways to style here, there are far to many! check out <a href="https://devdocs.io/css/">devdocs.io</a> for more specific information.</p>

        <h2>CSS Selectors</h2>
        <p>When you are styling something with the style block / elements or an external file you have to select the
            thing you wish to apply styles too. CSS allows for a few types of selectors:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Element</li>
            <ul>
                <li>To set styles for every element of the same type ( all h2's) on a page you can use the elements tag
                    (h2, p, img ) the element as the selector.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Classes</li>
            <ul>
                <li>To use classes place [ class="class-name" ] within the opening tag of the element to be styled, then
                    style with your preferred method.</li>
                <li>To style use [.class-name {styles} ]</li>
                <li>Elements can have as many classes as needed to get the look you are going for.</li>
                <li>Classes can be placed on as many elements as needed to get the look you are going for.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Id's</li>
            <ul>
                <li>To use id's place [ id="id-name" ] within the opening tag of the element to be styled, then style
                    with your preferred method.</li>
                <li>To style use [ #id-name {styles} ]</li>
                <li>Must be unique! Basically one use only.</li>
                <li>Each element can have only one id.</li>
                <li>Id's allow you to select and manipulate elements</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Attributes</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Styles are applied to elements with the matching attribute/value </li>
                <li>To style use [ attr=value {styles} ] </li>
                <li>Has many additional qualifier symbols </li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <p>Examples can be found in the files here.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 class="highlight">CSS Specificity</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The way you select elements to be styled set a level or priority that be overwritten or overwrite
                others. </li>
            <li>Where you place your styles matters as well. Styles are read top to bottom with things being nearer the
                top being overwritten by styles lower in the document. </li>
            <li>If you include !important in your declaration it will force it and over ride everything. </li>
            <li>How you select your elements can effect how things are applied to them.</li>
            <li>Inline styles > Id's > Classes, attributes and pseudo-classes > Elements and pseudo-elements </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p> You can import fonts from google by adding a link elements with
            [href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=font-name" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"] and setting the
            font-family property. If you do this it is best to create a fall back so that if the external font is not
            reachable you still have some control over the fonts. [font-family: FAMILY_NAME, GENERIC_NAME;] These
            generic font families include monospace, serif and sans-serif.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Box Model</h2>
        <p>HTML treats everything as boxes. We can control the way these boxes look by changing the properties of the
            box model:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="margined">Margin - The outer most box, is whitespace between the elements. Styles with margin
                properties</li>
            <li class="bordered">Border- Space for outlining the content and padding. Styled with border properties
            </li>
            <li class="padded">Padding- Whitespace between the content and border. Styled with padding properties.</li>
            <li class="contented">Content-Where your content is shown. Sized with content properties as well as hight
                and width for size control.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>With some of these you can use top, right, bottom, left properties or place them all in a single line
            [margin: 10px 20px 10px 20px;], or even [margin: 10px 20px]. In the second example the values are for
            top/bottom and right/left </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Common Length Units</h2>
        <p>You use length units to size elements. The types of length units are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Absolute- Not recommended, especially for font sizing. Users are unable to change these values with zoom
                functions causing negative usability.</li>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">px</span> - One pixel. </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Relative</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Font-relative lengths</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight">em</span> - Represents the calculated font-size of the element. If used
                        on the font-size property itself, it represents the inherited font-size of the element. </li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">rem</span> - Represents the font-size of the root element (typically
                        <html>). When used within the root element font-size, it represents its initial value (a common
                        browser default is 16px, but user-defined preferences may modify this).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Viewport-percentage lengths
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="highlight">vh</span> - Equal to 1% of the height of the viewport's initial
                            containing block. </li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">vw</span> - Equal to 1% of the width of the viewport's initial
                            containing block.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>CSS Variables</h2>
        <p>You can add variables to css to make styling faster. First you have to declare the variable in your style
            document. with [ --var-name: value; ]. You can then use them like: background-color: var(--var-name,
            fallback). It is also smart to place a fallbacks right before variables, this helps catch browser
            compatibility issues. Variables are only available withing the selector that they are declared, placing them
            in a :root selector will have them globally accessible. Variables have the same top to bottom rules as other
            declarations.</p>
