    <p>You can add styles with CSS in HTML tags with the style attribute. This is called inline CSS.</p>
    <p class="green-text">You can also add styles with a style block.</p>
    <p class="indigo-text">The most popular way to style is with external files. You have to link the external page for this to work.</p>

    <h2>CSS Selectors</h2>
    <p>When you are styling something with the style block / elements or an external file you have to select the thing you wish to apply styles too.   CSS allows for a few types of selectors:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Element</li>
        <ul>
            <li>To set styles for every element of the same type ( all h2's) on a page you can use the elements tag (h2, p, img ) the element as the selector.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Classes</li>
        <ul>
            <li>To use classes place [ class="class-name" ] within the opening tag of the element to be styled, then style with your preferred method.</li>
            <li>Elements can have as many classes as needed to get the look you are going for.</li>
            <li>Classes can be placed on as many elements as needed to get the look you are going for.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>??</li>
    </ol>
     </div>
     <div>
         <p> You can import fonts from google by adding a link elements with [href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=font-name" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"] and setting the font-family property. If you do this it is best to create a fall back so that if the external font is not reachable you still have some control over the fonts. [font-family: FAMILY_NAME, GENERIC_NAME;] These generic font families include monospace, serif and sans-serif.</p>
