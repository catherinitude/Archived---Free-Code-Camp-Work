    <h1>Flexbox Note</h1>
    <p>Flexbox can be used for creating dynamic UI layouts. it is highly customizable and gives a lot of power over how items are displayed on a page. To use all the styling properties for flexbox you need to set the display to flex, this turns it into a flex container. </p>
    <p>You can set how things flow with the flex-direction, justify-*, and align-* properties. Justify will work on the main axis, align on the cross axis. </p>
    <p>You can wrap items with flex-wrap. flex-shrink and flex-grow can help give space 'units' within the flex container. Yo can also control how things wrap with the flex-basis property. You can put all these on one line with the flex property.  flex: grow shrink flexbasis; </p>
    <p>You can even change the order of things with the order property.</p>
