        <h2>Benefits of Bees</h2>

          <h3>Plant Pollination</h3>
          <p>As they collect nectar for their hives, bees travel from plant to plant spreading pollen that collects on
            their furry legs and bodies. Aside from the many benefits of having bees in your garden, bees pollinate a
            shocking 85 percent of food crops intended for human consumption. Research suggests that bees are critical
            to
            our environment, climate change and even the production of coffee!</p>

          <h3>Food Preparation</h3>
          <p>Aside from pollinating pretty much everything we eat, bees are the only insect that produce a food consumed
            by humans. Just one of the many benefits of bees, honey provides numerous vitamins, minerals and
            antioxidants
            to our diets. Most notably, honey contains adequate levels of vitamins B1, B3 and B6, as well as minerals
            like
            calcium, iron, potassium and zinc.</p>

          <h3>Antibacterial Properties</h3>
          <p>In addition to its use as a healthy alternative to sugar in baked goods and cooking, honey has powerful
            antibacterial properties. It kills bacteria and prevents infection in skin wounds and has been shown to
            relieve allergies thanks to trace amounts of pollen. Although unproven, it has also been touted as a facial
            revitalizer with skin clearing and wrinkle reducing powers.</p>

          <h4>Wax Production</h4>
          <p>Bees house their honey in a fortress of wax honeycombs. As far back as the 6th century A.D., our ancestors
            used beeswax to make candles, develop cosmetics and even to fill cavities! Today, it is most commonly added
            to
            beauty products, wood furniture waxes and concrete polish. It’s also been used to preserve bronze and
            copper,
            waterproof leather and in the waxy coating on cheese rounds!</p>

      <h2>About this site</h2>
      <p>This page was created to demonstrate mastery of web development concepts like HTML and CSS. It was build to
        "pass the tests". I do not own images or text content r images above. I just think bees are kinda cool and if I
        had more then 3² feet of yard space I would for sure have a hive! The benefits information was pulled from <a
          href="https://www.americanpestpros.com/4-benefits-of-bees-and-what-to-do-about-their-disadvantages"> American
          Pest Professionals <a>. Images have credits in the source code!</p>
