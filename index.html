        <h2 id="NOTES">Notes about the Notes!</h2>
        <p>These notes are not meant to be a full documentation of these topics. They were created for me as a
            reference. Most of the information here is directly from the the site <a
                href=https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn>Free Code Camp</a>. From time to time I may have done extra
            research on an item and included it here.
        <p>
        <p>When I started creating these notes I had no clue what I was doing and did not focus on anything but learning the topics at hand. I made a page for each subject and linked to the next at the bottom. This was not easy to navigate! I also did not style the information, something I plan on fixing here! I am by no means and expert but I think I can do much better organizing this data on one easy to navigate page after learning what I have.
