               <p>
                    These notes are not meant to be a full documentation of these topics. They were created for me as a
                    reference. Most of the information here is directly from the the site <a
                        href=https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn>Free Code Camp</a>. From time to time I may have done
                    extra research and included some of that information here. Adding the credit and source of outside
                    information will be a high priority.
               <p>
               <p>
                    When I started creating these notes I had no clue what I was doing and did not focus on anything but
                    learning the topics at hand. I made a page for each subject and linked to the next at the bottom.
                    This was not easy to navigate! I also did not style the information, something I plan on fixing
                    here! I am by no means and expert but I think I can do much better organizing this data on one easy
                    to navigate page after learning what I have.
               </p>
               <p>
                    I started revamping things as I was working my way through the projects at the end of the Responsive
                    Web Design Certification Section of <a href=https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn>Free Code Camp</a>
                    and I will continue to update this as I learn more skills!

                    <h3>Tag Anatomy</h3>
                         <p>
                              HTML is compose of tags. Browsers use these tags to format the structure of a webpage and display content. Most of the tags require both opening and closing tags. There are a handful of self closing tags. These tags are used to define Elements.
                         </p>
                         <pre>
                              <code>&#60;opening tag&#62; Content &#60;closing tag&#62;</code>
                         </pre>
                         <p>
                              Several things can go in the opening tag, but the element name is mandatory and should be the first thing in the tag. Opening tags can also include attributes, some elements even require attributes.  Closing tags hold the element name preceded by a slash (/). Below is an example of a tag with some attributes. This tag will place a link on the page, with a class, id and a title. Because of the target attribute it will open uin a new tap or window.
                         </p>   
                         <pre>

                    <h3>A Multitude of Elements</h3>
                         <p>
                              HTML has a ton of elements to help structure a page. Some of these tags are on every HTML page and some are rarely used. A list of every tag  (I think) can be found on <a href="https://devdocs.io/html-elements/" title="Link to devDocs.io">DevDocs.io</a>. Convention is to keep elements lowercase.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Tags that are on every page don't directly do anything to the page content, they provide data to help other things structure the page, import styles and scripts, and provide meta information. These type of tags live in the head section of the page. If you look at the <a href="#boilerplate">boilerplate</a> above you can see some examples. More information about the head section and what it can house can be found at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head" title="Link to MDN Web Docs">MDN Web Docs</a>.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Other elements are "fancy containers". These are called semantic elements, they have a meaning and hold certain type of data. These elements help with search engine optimization, other read your code,  as well as accessability. A few semantic elements are:

                         Semantic elements are important, but they generally don't create anything we can see on the page. HTML has a ton of elements that do create things we can display on the page, too many to go over here. Some commons ones are:

                    <p>
                         Basic HTML looks very plain CSS can be used to make elements looks better! You can add CSS directly to a element with a style attribute or within a style element at the top of the body. These two ways work but the most popular way to style with CSS is byt placing the CSS code in its own file then linking to the file via a link element in the head of a page.

                                JavaScript allows for function and logic on a page and can get complicated as the function grows. Because of this keeping code formatted in a consistent way is important. To help keep things straight for not only yourself but others leaving valuable comments is good practice. comments can be placed like so"

                    <h3>Variables and Data types</h3>
                    <p>
                         JavaScript allows many types of data, but is a 'loosely typed' language that does not require you to tell the code what your data is when you declare it.  Declaring a variable means that you are telling your program you have some data and what you want to call that data. For example if we needed to do something in your code based on age you might create (declare) a variable called age. There are many data types, you can see them at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_datatypes.asp" target="_blank">w3schools.com</a>.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                         <code>keyword name = value; </code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                         Above is the anatomy of a variable declaration. The keyword can be one of 
                         <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var" target=_blank>var</a>,  
                         <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let" target=_blank>let</a>, or  
                         <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const" target=_blank>const</a>. The name must start with a letter but can be any combination of letters, numbers, underscores and dollar signs. Names are also case sensitive. The equals sign is called the assignment operator in java script. You are assigning the value you set to the name you set.  The value can be any number of things. The only thing to consider is if the value is a string (words) or a numerical value. Numerical values and strings don't mix, 5 + apple is not something you can do. Strings are encapsulated with single or double quotes.

                                   The whole point of having variables to store and use changeable data and of course we have several ways to do this! You can simply give the variable a new value buy reassigning it something new. This new value can even be another variable or the result of other parts of the program.

var a;
var b;

//adding values to the variables
a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";

                              Camel Case is the industry standard for naming variable in JavaScript.  With this way f writing variables you start with a lowercase letter then capitalize every word in a multi-word variable. thisIsAveryLongVariableNameButItIsInCamleCase.

                         <h3>Dealing with Strings</h3>
                              <p>
                                   As said before strings are encapsulated with quotes, but what if you need your string to have quotes? There are a few ways to do this. First you can escape the string.  This is done by placing \ before each quote that needs to be escaped.  This can be tricky and take up a ton of time if you need to escape a large about of quotes.  An easier way is to encapsulate your string with single quotes, doing this allows you to use double quotes in the string.
                              </p>
                         <pre>
                              <code>var sampleStr = "I am \"Escaping!\" The string."; 
Var singleQuote = 'I can use "as" many "quotes" as "I" want';
                              </code>
                         </pre>
                         <p>
                          Quotes are not the only thing you can escape in strings. To be honest I hope to learn a better way to do this. If for some reason its is needed more information can be found over at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_strings.asp" target="blank">w3schools</a>.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                         Finally you can "add" strings together with the addition operators ( + and +=). This is called concatenation. You can also display variables via concatenation.
                         </p>
                         <pre>
                              <code>var myName = "Catherinitude";
var myStr = 'My name is ' + myName +' and I am well!'; </code>
                         </pre>
                    <p>
                    JavaScript allow for us to get information about data including strings. One of them is .length and it is used like so:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                         <code>myString.length</code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                         This will return an integer that is equal to the number of characters in the string (minus 1). This is because JavaScript is a Zero-based indexing language. This means that the first value is 0.  .length works much the same with other things. some Examples:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                         <code>var myString= 'Hello from JavaScript';
myString.length will return 21
</code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                         You can target specific parts of a string by adding brackets at the end and adding the position you wish to target.  You can ask for .length-1 to get the last value.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                    <code>var myString= 'Hello from JavaScript';
myString.length[7]      // will return r
myString.[myString.length-1]      //  will return t
myString.[myString.length-4]      //  will return r</code>

                         <h3>Arrays</h3>
                         <p>
                              Arrays are JavaScript variables that store many pieces of data. Arrays are contained in square brackets with comma separated items and can be manipulated in various ways!
                         </p>
                         <pre>
                              <code>var myArray=["Catherinitude", "Code", 13, "Happy", 
"challenge", "axis", "family", "buy", "soil", "fence", 
"unique", "familiar", "incongruous", 
"grass", "cultural", "pool", "divorce", "flavor"];</code></pre>
                         <p>
                              Arrays items can be anything, even other arrays! In the above array of simple items myArray.length would return 18, the the array below my.Array.length would return 3.
                         </p>
                         <pre>
                              <code>var myArray=[
["Catherinitude", "Code", 13],
["Happy", "challenge", 14], 
["family", "buy", 12], 
["soil", "fence", 8]];</code></pre>

                              </tr>
                              <tr>
                                   <td>unshift()</td>

                                   <td>Adds item in first position in an array.</td>

                              Using combinations of the above methods can be quite powerful. For example you can change items in an array via selecting it then setting it to a new value. Navigating an arrays of arrays can be more complicated, but only as complicated as the array. for example:
                         </p>
                         <pre>
                              <code>var arr = [
[1,2,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,9],

                         <h3>Functions</h3>
                         <p>
                              Functions allow for the use of code repeatably. This is useful so that you can repeat actions without having to retype code. Keeping repetition of code to a minimum is important. Concise code helps keep code easy to understand as well as optimized. If you need to do something more then once if belongs in a function!  A function looks like this:
                         </p>
                         <pre>
                              <code>function functionName(comma, separated, parameters){
// function code lives here for example:
return(comma + separated + parameters);
//This will add all three parameters values together.
}                            
functionName(1, 5, 4) // would return 10
</code>
                         </pre>
                         <p>
                              Generally your function will need to return something this is done with return() method. Once the function returns something it stops working so only one return per function can be returned. Functions can be super simple or huge and complicated.

                         <h3>Scope</h3>
                         <p>
                              Scope is basically where variables can be seen / used. There are several levels of scope. The largest scope is global scope.  Variables declared with the var keyword are created in global scope. Global scope lets everything interact with it and can have some issues. The other type os scope is local scope. There is a nice article at <a href="https://scotch.io/tutorials/understanding-scope-in-javascript" target="_blank">Scotch.io</a> on what each scope is and how it is used.

                    <h3>If Statements</h3>
                    <p>
                         If statements are used to test data and do things based on the outcome of the tests. This testing is done with logical operators found above in <a href="#logops">Logical Operators Table</a>. 
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                         <code>if (testing logic) {
     do this if testing logic is true
} 
     do this if testing logic is false
}</code></pre>
                    <p>
                    The above is the most basic if statements, they can be made more complicated like this:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                         <code>if (testing logic 1) {
if testing logic 1 is true do this
} else if (testing logic 2) {
if testing logic 2 is true do this
} else if (testing logic 3) {
if testing logic 3 is true do this
} else if (testing logic4) {
if testing logic 4 is true do this
} else {
if everything is false do this
}</code></pre>
                         <p>It is important when working with longer statements to keep in mind that JavaScript reads and executes code in top down left right order. This means if you have a test for  less than 25 followed by a test for less than 5 and your testing 4, code will be triggered at less than 25 and the less than 5 will never be tested.
                         </p>

                    <h3>Switches</h3>
                    <p>Like If statements switch statements allow for logical manipulation of data by matching rules with code to run. In switch statements you use a default value to as a catch all. When something matched the case the code is run until it hits a break statement.</p>
                    <pre>
                         <code>switch (testing logic) {
     case 0:
          code here is triggered when 0 is the result of the testing logic
          break;
     case "apple":
          code here is triggered when "apple" is the result of the testing logic
          break;
     case 32:
          code here is triggered when 0 is the result of the testing logic
          break;
     default :
          code here is triggered when no other cases are met that is why its at the end
          break;
     }</code>

                         <h3>Boolean Magic</h3>
                         <p>sometimes you can skip if statements and switch statements if you just need to know if something is true or false. </p>
                    <pre>
                         <code>function isEqual(a,b) {
     if (a === b) {
          return true;                                      
     } else {
          return false;
     }
     }

     --OR--

     function isEqual(a,b) {
          return a === b;
        }

                         </code>
