# Free-Code-Camp-Work      ![Staus- ARCHIVED](https://img.shields.io/badge/Staus-ARCHIVED-blue)
A collection of my work done while learning with: https://www.freecodecamp.org/


# Note Migration:
The note taking portion of this quickly became unmanageable and more work then the actual learning. I have migrated the notes here to notion.so. These notes are not meant to be useful for others so that is a better place for them. 

# Project Migration:
Capstone / Mastery Projects will live on my [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/catherinitude) or [Repl.it](https://repl.it/@Catherinitude)
